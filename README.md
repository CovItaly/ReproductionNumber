## Estimating *R_t* in Real-Time

The following notebooks by [Michele Tizzoni](https://github.com/micheletizzoni) reproduce the estimate of the time-varying reproductive number for Italy:

* [National level](https://github.com/micheletizzoni/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R%20-%20Italy.ipynb)
* [Subnational level](https://github.com/micheletizzoni/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R%20-%20Italian%20Regions.ipynb)

**NB**: The method is based on some strong assumptions. However, the results are pretty much in line with those, more statistically solid, reported by Sam Abbott [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid).
